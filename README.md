# WCRAI Project: Lung disease detectiond using AI

The WCRAI (Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen Artificial Intelligence) project aims to enhance the radiological field with an advanced AI algorithm designed to analyze X-ray images. This AI-driven approach seeks to improve the accuracy and speed of pneumonia detection, distinguishing between various forms such as viral and bacterial pneumonia.

## Objectives
- To provide faster and more precise diagnostics, assisting radiologists in decision-making.
- To integrate the AI system within the radiological workflow, optimizing operational efficiency.

## Features
- Utilization of deep learning methods for continuous improvement of the algorithm's performance.
- Democratization of access to quality diagnostic tools.

## Impact
The project aspires to revolutionize radiology by improving patient care worldwide, making quality diagnostics more accessible, and paving the way for the application of AI in various medical disciplines.
